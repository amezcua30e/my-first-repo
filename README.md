# my-first-repo
I recently graduate in May 2023 from Brandeis University with a B.A. in economics and film studies. I am currently doing a master's degree in international economics and finance with a concentration in data analytics. I have been able to intern at a small consulting firm and do work that has given me skills in analysis, media, and much more.
